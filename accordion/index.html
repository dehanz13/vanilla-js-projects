                React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in
                2011.
              </li>
              <li>
                It follows the component based approach which helps in building
                reusable UI components.

              <li>
                It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile
                UI.

                Even though it was open-sourced only in 2015, it has one of the
                largest communities supporting it.

            Major features of React are listed below:
            <ul>
              <li>
                It uses the <span>virtual DOM</span> instead of the real DOM.
              </li>
              <li>It uses <span>server-side rendering</span>.</li>
              <li>
                It follows <span>uni-directional data flow</span> or data
                binding.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="accordion-item-header">What is Props?</div>
        <div class="accordion-item-body">
          <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
            Props is the shorthand for Properties in React. They are read-only
            components which must be kept pure i.e. immutable. They are always
            passed down from the parent to the child components throughout the
            application. A child component can never send a prop back to the
            parent component. This help in maintaining the unidirectional data
            flow and are generally used to render the dynamically generated
            data.

          What are the different phases of React component’s lifecycle?
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-item-body">
          <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
            There are three different phases of React component’s lifecycle:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Initial Rendering Phase:</span> This is the phase when the
                component is about to start its life journey and make its way to
                the DOM.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Updating Phase:</span> Once the component gets added to
                the DOM, it can potentially update and re-render only when a
                prop or state change occurs. That happens only in this phase.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Unmounting Phase:</span> This is the final phase of a
                component’s life cycle in which the component is destroyed and
                removed from the DOM.
