### An app to keep track of your reading 

* Add books to the list
* Store book details to the browser's Local Storage so the list is persistent even when the page is reloaded
* When an entry is removed from the list, it should also be cleared from the Local Storage
* 2 versions: 1 with Vanilla JS, 1 with Classes (OOP)

### Created 2 versions
> To switch versions, change the script source in the index.html file
1. Vanilla JS - src="app.js"
2. Classes (OOP) - src="app-class.js"
